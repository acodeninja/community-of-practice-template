## What is a Community of Practice?

A community of practice (CoP) is a group of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how
to do it better as they interact regularly. CoPs are for people who share common job roles, responsibilities or remits. 

A CoP can evolve naturally because of the members' common interest in a particular domain or area, or it can be created 
deliberately with the goal of gaining knowledge related to a specific field. It is through the process of sharing 
information and experiences with the group that members learn from each other, and have an opportunity to develop 
personally and professionally.

You can find out more about how to set up a CoP around a specific discipline on the 
[Community Development Framework](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/community-development-framework) guidance pages from 
GOV.UK.
